# Rome

Rome is a tool that allows developers on Apple platforms to use Amazon's S3 or a local folder as a
shared cache for frameworks built with [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

## Get Rome
`$ brew install blender/homebrew-tap/rome`

The Rome binary is also attached as a zip to each release on the [releases page](https://github.com/blender/Rome/releases) here on GitHub.

Using Rome? Let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/blender/Rome/issues/new)
and I will gladly add you to the user list.

## Use Rome with fastlane

You can integrate Rome into your [fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) automation with the
[fastlane plugin for Rome](https://github.com/netbe/fastlane-plugin-rome).

## The problem

Suppose you're working a number of frameworks for your project and want to
share those with your team. A great way to do so is to use Carthage and
have team members point the `Cartfile` to the new framework version (or branch, tag, commit)
and run `carthage update`.

Unfortunately this will require them to build from scratch the new framework.
This is particularly annoying if the dependency tree for that framework is big
and / or takes a long time to build.

## The solution

Use a cache. The first team member can build the framework and share it while all
other developers can get it from the cache with no waiting time.

## Workflow

The Rome's workflow changes depending if you are the producer (i.e. the first
person in your team to build the framework) or the consumer.

### Producer workflow

```bash
$ vi Cartfile # point to the new version of the framework
$ carthage update && rome upload
```

### Consumer workflow

```bash
$ vi Cartfile # point to the new version of the framework
$ carthage update --no-build && rome download
```

or

```bash
$ vi Cartfile.resolved # point to the new version of the framework
$ rome download
```
## Set up and Usage

- First you need a `.aws/credentials` file in your home folder. This is used to specify
your AWS Credentials.
- Second you need a `.aws/config` file in your home folder. This is used to specify the AWS
region.
- Third you need a `Romefile` in the project where you want to use Rome. At the
same level where the `Cartfile` is.

### Setting up AWS credentials

Since version `0.2.0.0` Rome will expect to find credentials either as environment
variables `$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or in a file at
`.aws/credentials`. This aligns Rome behavior to other tools that use Amazon's SDK. See
[Amazon's blogpost on the topic](https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx3D6U6WSFGOK2H/A-New-and-Standardized-Way-to-Manage-Credentials-in-the-AWS-SDKs).

In your home folder create a `.aws/credentials` like the following

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = SECRET_KEY
```

this should look something like

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AGIAJQARMD67CE3DTKHA
aws_secret_access_key = TedRV2/dFkBr1H3D7xuPsF9+CBHTjK0NKrJuoVs8
```

these will be the credentials that Rome will use to access S3 on your behalf.
To use configurations other than the `default` profile set the `$AWS_PROFILE`
environment variable to your desired profile.

### Selecting the AWS Region

In your home folder create a `.aws/config` like the following

```
[default]
region = us-east-1
```

To use configurations other than the `default` profile set the `$AWS_PROFILE`
environment variable to your desired profile.

### Romefile

The Romefile has three purposes:

1. Specifies what caches to use - `[Cache]` section. This section is __required__.
1. Allows to use custom name mappings between repository names and framework names - `[RepositoryMap]` section. This section is __optional__ and can be omitted.
1. Allows to ignore certain framework names - `[IgnoreMap]` section. This section is __optional__ and can be omitted.

A Romefile looks like this:

```
[Cache]
  S3-Bucket = ios-dev-bucket
  local = ~/Library/Caches/Rome/

[RepositoryMap]
  HockeySDK-iOS = HockeySDK
  awesome-framework-for-cat-names = CatFramework
  better-dog-names = DogFramework

[IgnoreMap]
  xcconfigs = xcconfigs
```  

The Romefile is in the [INI format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file)

#### Cache section
This section must contain __at least one__ between:
- the name of the S3 Bucket to upload/download to/from. The key `S3-Bucket` is __optional__ since Rome `0.11.0.x`.
- the path to local directory to use as an additional cache. The key `local` is __optional__.

#### RepositoryMap
This contains the mappings of git repository names with framework names.
This is particularly useful in case you are not using github and the "Organization/FrameworkName" convention.

Example:

Suppose you have the following in your `Cartfile`

```
github "Alamofire/Alamofire" ~> 4.3.0
github "bitstadium/HockeySDK-iOS" "3.8.6"
git "http://stash.myAnimalStartup.com/scm/iossdk/awesome-framework-for-cat-names.git" ~> 3.3.1
git "http://stash.myAnimalStartup.com/scm/iossdk/better-dog-names.git" ~> 0.4.4
```

which translates to the following `Carftfile.resolved`

```
github "Alamofire/Alamofire" "4.3.0"
github "bitstadium/HockeySDK-iOS" "3.8.6"
git "http://stash.myAnimalStartup.com/scm/iossdk/awesome-framework-for-cat-names.git" "3.3.1"
git "http://stash.myAnimalStartup.com/scm/iossdk/better-dog-names.git" "0.4.4"
```

but your framework names are actually `HockeySDK`, `CatFramework` and `DogFramework`
as opposed to `HockeySDK-iOS`, `awesome-framework-for-cat-names` and `better-dog-names`.

simply add a `[RepositoryMap]` section to your `Romefile` and specify the following mapping:

```
[Cache]
  S3-Bucket = ios-dev-bucket

[RepositoryMap]
  HockeySDK-iOS = HockeySDK
  awesome-framework-for-cat-names = CatFramework
  better-dog-names = DogFramework
```

#### IgnoreMap
This contains the mappings of git repository names and framework names should be ignored.
This is particularly useful in case not all your `Cartfile.resolved` entries produce a framework.

Some repositories use Carthage as a simple mechanism to include other git repositories that do not produce frameworks.
Even Carthage itself does this, to include xcconfigs.


Example:

Suppose you have the following in your `Cartfile`

```
github "Quick/Nimble"
github "jspahrsummers/xcconfigs"
```

`xcconfigs` can be ignored by Rome by adding an `IgnoreMap` section in the Romefile


```
[IgnoreMap]
  xcconfigs = xcconfigs
```

##### Multiple Aliases

Since version `0.6.0.10` Rome supports multiple aliases for one map entry.
Suppose you have a framework `Framework` that builds two targets, `t1` and `t2`,
Rome can handle both targets by specifying

```
[RepositoryMap]
  Framework = t1, t2
```

If __ANY__ of the aliases is missing on S3, the entire entry will be reported as missing
when running `rome list [--missing]`

Multiple aliases are supported in `[IgnoreMap]` too

```

#### Uploading

Uploading one or more frameworks, corresponding dSYMs and [Carthage version files](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/VersionFile.md)
if present
(an empty list of frameworks will upload all frameworks found in `Cartfile.resolved`):

Referring to the `Cartfile.resolved` in [RepositoryMap](#repositorymap)

```bash
$ rome upload Alamofire
Uploaded Alamofire to: Alamofire/iOS/Alamofire.framework-4.3.0.zip
Uploaded Alamofire.dSYM to: Alamofire/iOS/Alamofire.framework.dSYM-4.3.0.zip
Uploaded Alamofire to: Alamofire/tvOS/Alamofire.framework-4.3.0.zip
Uploaded Alamofire.dSYM to: Alamofire/tvOS/Alamofire.framework.dSYM-4.3.0.zip
Uploaded Alamofire to: Alamofire/watchOS/Alamofire.framework-4.3.0.zip
Uploaded Alamofire.dSYM to: Alamofire/watchOS/Alamofire.framework.dSYM-4.3.0.zip
```

Uploading for a specific platform (all platforms are uploaded by default):

```bash
$ rome upload --platform ios Alamofire
Uploaded Alamofire to: Alamofire/iOS/Alamofire.framework-4.3.0.zip
Uploaded Alamofire.dSYM to: Alamofire/iOS/Alamofire.framework.dSYM-4.3.0.zip
```

If a local cache is specified in your `Romefile` and you wish to ignore it pass `--skip-local-cache` on the command line.

#### Downloading

Downloading one or more frameworks, corresponding dSYMs and
[Carthage version files](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/VersionFile.md)
if present
(an empty list of frameworks will download all frameworks found in `Cartfile.resolved`):

Referring to the `Cartfile.resolved` in [RepositoryMap](#repositorymap)

```bash
$ rome download Alamofire
Downloaded Alamofire from: Alamofire/iOS/Alamofire.framework-4.3.0.zip
Downloaded Alamofire.dSYM from: Alamofire/iOS/Alamofire.framework.dSYM-4.3.0.zip
Error downloading Alamofire : The specified key does not exist.
Error downloading Alamofire.dSYM : The specified key does not exist.

```

Downloading for a specific platform (all platforms are downloaded by default):

```bash
$ rome download --platform ios,watchos Alamofire
Downloaded Alamofire from: Alamofire/iOS/Alamofire.framework-4.3.0.zip
Downloaded Alamofire.dSYM from: Alamofire/iOS/Alamofire.framework.dSYM-4.3.0.zip
Downloaded Alamofire from: Alamofire/watchOS/Alamofire.framework-4.3.0.zip
Downloaded Alamofire.dSYM from: Alamofire/watchOS/Alamofire.framework.dSYM-4.3.0.zip
```

If a local cache is specified in your `Romefile` and you wish to ignore it pass `--skip-local-cache` on the command line.

#### Listing

Listing frameworks and reporting on their availability:

```bash
$ rome list
Alamofire 4.3.0 : +iOS -macOS +tvOS +watchOS
ResearchKit 1.4.1 : +iOS -macOS -tvOS -watchOS
```

Listing only frameworks present in the cache:

```bash
$ rome list --present
Alamofire 4.3.0 : +iOS +tvOS +watchOS
ResearchKit 1.4.1 : +iOS
```

Listing only frameworks missing from the cache:

```bash
$ rome list --missing
Alamofire 4.3.0 : -macOS
ResearchKit 1.4.1 : -macOS -tvOS -watchOS
```

Listing frameworks missing for specific platforms:

```bash
$ rome list --missing --platform watchos,tvos
ResearchKit 1.4.1 : -tvOS -watchOS
```

Forwarding a list of missing frameworks to Carthage for building:

```bash
$ rome list --missing --platform ios | awk '{print $1}' | xargs carthage build --platform ios
*** xcodebuild output can be found in ...
```

Note: `list` __completely ignores dSYMs and Carthage version files__. If a dSYM
or a [Carthage version file](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/VersionFile.md) 
is missing, __the corresponding framework is still reported as present__.
