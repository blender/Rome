### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Rome? You can start by looking through issues `beginner` and `help-wanted`:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/blender/Rome/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abeginner) - issues which are quite small, self contained and simple to solve
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/blender/Rome/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.
